This program is a fleet management tool for remotely operated vehicles (like a toy car, or a drone). 

A user will connect to a fleet, and will be connected to the vehicle with the lowest number of drive hours available (see notes below). They can then 'operate' that vehicle until they've finished, and then they will end the session. Imagine if you are at work, and want to drive a toy car around your home remotely. The bit that is for remotely operating the vehicle will use WebRTC to see a low latency camera feed and make the car drive around/change directions, but that is out of the scope of this assignment.
